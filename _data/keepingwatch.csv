chicken-peak,,chickenpeak_theta.JPG,Chicken Peak,Keeping Watch,,Chcken Peak is a decomissioned Lookout that is currently in ruin deep in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. It is 14x14 cabin with a distinctly angled roof. One side is painted bright orange; this was used to guide planes before modern GPS and radar technology. The structure was built in 1933. ,"Five thousand feet below us the Salmon River rushed by and high mountain wildflowers bloomed, more species than I could count or identify, really. They seemed to be some kind of mountain heather and cinquefoil. On a ridge above us, Chicken Peak must be the most unique cabin in the entire state of Idaho with its prominent roof and bright orange paint. Inside the floor was collapsing around an intact podium upon which the fire finder once sat. On this podium were the initials of lovers collected over the years. I took out my pocket knife and carved MD + KW with a heart around it. ""Oh shit smoke"" Jack says. I turn around and stare out of the smashed windows, my gaze directed in a very particular way, and see a plume of smoke rising from behind a ridge. For hours, we watched the plume grow into a cloud and, briefly, the sun burst through the smoke creating a kaleidoscopic refraction. What we were seeing was the Dixie Jumbo Fire, as confirmed by a friend through a text message on my Garmin InReach.

cold-mountain-lookout,,cold_mountain_theta.jpg,Cold Mountain,Keeping Watch,,"Cold Mountain Lookout is a small bodied, steel Aremotor tower. Originally built in 1994 it sat on Cold Mountain in the Payette National Forest. With the growing obsoloescence of fire towers in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, many such steel towers were taken down. This was due to the relative ease of disassembling the pre-fabricated kits these towers were built from. Cold Mountain, in particular, was targeted as an easy removal because of its proximity to the nearby Cold Meadows Air Field. In 1994, it was dissassembled and aquired by the Holm family of McCall, Idaho. The cabin now sits at a reduced height, having once stood over one-hundred above the ground. ","<p>""I've been to a lot of lookouts, but I'm kind of like you guys: I've collected stories, not so much my own."" The word ""collected"" can be taken literally as we are sitting in the former Cold Mountain Lookout cabin, now located in Richard's front yard. It is part of a massive collection of Idaho lookout artifacts that he has gathering for years. The three of us interviewing Richard are, in fact, like him; as literature and philosophy scholars, we often live vicariously through the experiences and ideas of others, and this project, it seems, is attempting to overcome such vicariousness. Already, the surreality of standing in this tower which has been taken physically from its original context-- in order to be preserved-- already feels like a story our team is making. This project is an experience we will talk about, perhaps, while being interviewed by a younger generation asking us what it was like to preserve the history of fire towers before they were gone. </p> <p>Richard talks in an encycopedic way about the specific towers he has been to, why they were built the way they were, why they were eventually taken down, and why some have endured in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. What has kept people interested in them? Partially, we think, it has to do with their aesthetic charm, and, certainly, something about their mountain top locations. It is also likely something with the way the lookout and its remote location can dislocate one from the ordinariness of their lives. This is evident in the dislocated setting of the former Cold Mountain Lookout.</p> <p>In the end of ""The Trouble with Wilderness"", William Cronon says, ""[honoring the wild] means looking at the part of nature we intend to turn toward our own ends and asking whether we can use it again and again and again--sustainably--without its being diminished in the process. [...] Most of all, it means practicing rememberance and gratitude, for thanksgiving is the simplest and most basic of ways for us to recollect the nature, the culture, and the history that have come together to make the world as we know it."" (90) Richard Holm talks at length about the human and natural history of Idaho. He is an expert recollector, a master of remembering.</p>",Lookouts; McCall; Richard Holm; Preservation; Forest Service; Cold Mountain; Environmentalism; Green Revolution; Aerial Photography; Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness,"McCall, Idaho",45.2497139,-114.9490776,,,record,compound_object,eng,,,firetower,/objects/cold_mountain_theta.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/small/cold_mountain_theta_sm.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/thumbs/cold_mountain_theta_th.jpg

diablo-mountain,,,Diablo Mountain,Keeping Watch,2021-07-16,"Diabo Peak Lookout is an R-6 cabin that sits on a concrete foundation in the Bitterroot Mountains near the Powell Ranger Station and Lochsa River. It is run by Bill Moore, son of former Lochsa district ranger and conservationist, Bud Moore. Diablo is staffed by various volunteers rather than a single paid lookout. The value of a volunteer program, Bill says, is that is gives multiple people, who would otherwise not have the time to devote to an entire fire season, the chance to experience lookout life and the solitude that comes with it. ","On our way to the Diablo trailhead, we stop off at The Lochsa Lodge, an old hunting lodge with rental cabins, a gift shop, and restaurant. I connect to their WIFI and check my messages. Bill has texted me direction using his Garmin InReach—the messages come through in one-hundred-and-sixty character pieces.

hell-s-half-acre,,hells_half_theta.JPG,Hell's Half Acre,,,"Hells Half Acre is an R-6 cabin that is easily accessible by road in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Originally a platform on top of a forty-foot-tall tower, the original Hell’s Half Acre cabin was an L-4.  Now one of the most popular lookouts in Idaho or Montana, it sits above a snag forest of mostly lodgepole pine. A sign at the base of the summit informs drivers that the tower opens at 9 am. Unsure if this refers to mountain or pacific time, we wait at the sign and drink our coffee. ","We are greeted by a towering figure, well over six-feet-tall. His name is Patrick McCarron, and he is filling in for the regular lookout, a young man getting his MFA in creative writing at the University of Montana. I notice a copy of Barry Lopez's <i> Arctic Dreams <i/> on a table near the stove. Patrick lets us record him taking the weather report for the day—hot and dry with a light yet consistent wind. His voice is smoky and he talks how I believe people did before social media and cell phones, in an exuberant, magical way. We discuss fire suppression and Patrick iterates that fire is a necessary component of forest ecosystems, sure to mention the severity of fires in the modern age; “I don’t want to see suffering” he says “but here we are, the conundrum.” ",Lookouts; Magruder Corridor; Selway River; Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness; Hell's Half Acre; Forest Service; Climate Change; Smoke; Saint Maries Peak; Staffed Lookouts,Magruder Corridor ,45.64579,-114.62838,,,record,compound_object,eng,,,firetower,/objects/hells_half_theta.JPG,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/small/hells_half_theta_sm.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/thumbs/hells_half_theta_th.jpg

roughneck-peak,,roughneck-theta1.jpg,Roughneck Peak,Keeping Watch,2021-08-23,"Roughneck Lookout is an L-4 cabin in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, twenty-one miles northwest of Stanley, Idaho, on the edge of the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return. It is surrounded by a collection of small mountain lakes. It is also the setting of Don Scheese's book <i>Mountains of Memory: A Fire Lookout's Life in the River of No Return Wilderness</i> (2000); a novel about an individual's influence on a vast landscape, and a blend of Muir-like prose and critical literary studies. ","We noticed the high-water marks around the shorelines of the lakes as we hiked up the trail. The water was low due to a combination of severe drought and tectonic alteration from a recent earthquake. Up higher, the tower was beginning to take shape and I could see a looming figure hunched over a yogurt container eating breakfast. I let out an insecure howdy and watched whoever was inside fumble to put on a shirt. A man came out and introduced himself as Andy Baca—a long-time lookout and elk hunting guide with a PhD in history. Andy would stare off into the landscape as he talked, and we asked questions about working and living on lookouts. “It’s a little geologically sketchy up here. But you know if my time is up, it’s up, I guess. I would rather be buried up here than anywhere else.” Behind the lookout was a large fissure in the ground.",Lookouts; Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness; Mountains of Memory; Don Scheese; Earthquake; Obsolescence; Staffed Lookouts,Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness,44.48270554,-115.155742,,,record,compound_object,,,,firetower,/objects/roughneck-theta1.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/small/roughneck-theta3_sm.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/thumbs/roughneck-theta3_th.jpg

Most lookouts we interviewed at least mentioned Sheepeater. It has a mythic quality among lookouts seeking solitude.

Lifelong lookouts, the Moaks have been described to us as “the finest eyes in the Forest Service.” Their names came up repeatedly in interviews with other lookouts and a summer of loose correspondence with Mark landed us a late-September interview. ","The air was becoming cooler, the nights uncomfortably cold. It was that eco-tone between summer and fall—not quite either and both at once. The trail up to Spot is steep—about five-thousand feet of elevation gain in a little over six miles. We were greeted warmly by the Moaks at the top of the mountain and a distinct southern draw in their voices made me feel comfortable and welcomed. We sat down with them to discuss their long tenure with the Forest Service, having a vision on the mountain top, environmental ethics, and what might be lost in the transition away from the human staffed lookout.

st-maries-peak,,,St. Maries Peak,,,St. Mary's Peak is a currently staffed lookout fire lookout in the Lolo National Forest. It is an L-4 cabin that sits ontop of a wooden base enclosed by local rock. ,"<p>This lookout was not on our original list to visit, nor had we heard of it. However, after meeting Patrick McCarron who was staffing Hell's Half Acre, we learned about this still active lookout. Patrick has been the primary lookout on St. Mary's Peak for some time and takes the role of steward very seriously. He let us know that much of the role of a lookout on an easily accessible hike like St. Mary's is spent keeping people off the wild flowers.</p><p> There is no lookout on site when we get there, too early, I suppose. Chris climbs onto the cabin to get a Theta picture of the surrounding area. I cannot help but notice how church-like the building looks with it's fresh coat of white paint. It is not difficult to see how synonmous the lookout has become with religion. It is also fitting after hearing Patrick's story about his interaction with a Catholic church goup. Maybe it has less to do with religion and more to do with belief, which is something most lookouts seem to have, whether that be a belief in institutions or governments, religion, or human history. The lookout is both a government building and a church, simultaneously.</p><p> The thought comes to me that the term lookout has a strange duality: it refers to both structure and person, and hints at the relationship, or perhaps the singularity, between and of the two. Patrick is a very tower-like person, and this lookout is very patrick-like.</p>",,,46.500517,-114.204018,,,record,compound_object,eng,,,firetower,/objects/st_mary_theta.JPG,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/small/st_mary_theta_sm.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/thumbs/st_mary_theta_th.jpg

The tower is built ontop of a rock outcropping that sits at the highest point of the mountain. The lookout has a complete view of Priest Lake as well as the Selkirk Crest, part of the Belt Supergroup that is roughly 1.3 billion years old and once sat below a shallow sea. Sundance is also the site of the 1967 Sundance Fire which was ignited by lightning just below the site of the lookout. A plaque is erected nearby to the fire fighters who lost their lives in this fire. </tr>

A long time lookout preservationist named Gary Webber got us in touch with her and she was consistently, yet ambigously, in contact with us from the beginning. We met her at the base of Sundance Mountain Lookout after my Subaru Forester nearly overheated hauling me, Jack, Chris, and my dog, Trout, up the steep mountain road that gets you to the tower. Pam was doing repairs and getting the cabin ready for fire season.</p> <p>Talking to her, it is clear that she has seen a range of lookout utilization in the American West. She comments, sadly, that she is the only lookout left. This is not entirely true, but when you are in a cabin, talking to the few who do remain, it is easy to <i>feel</i> like this is true, and you can easily see how it is <i>becoming</i> true.</p>",Lookouts; L-4; Priest Lake; Selkirk Mountains; North Idaho; Volunteer; Idaho Department of Lands; Sundance Fire,Priest Lake,48.49076,-116.75149,,,record,compound_object,eng,,,firetower,/objects/sundance_theta.JPG,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/small/sundance_theta_sm.jpg,https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/objects/thumbs/sundance_theta_th.jpg
