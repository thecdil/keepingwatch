excerpt001,In a forest under proper protection there is some one man or corps of men responsible for detecting fires and for attacking them before they have time to do much damage or to develop beyond control.,Henry Graves,Second Chief Forest Service,/objects/henry_graves.jpg,image,Henry Graves and Franklin Moon at New York State College of Forestry circa 1919,henry_graves.jpg,/objects/henry_graves.jpg,1910,Forest History Society
excerpt002,"Peering thru the drift of smoke, sighting thru the haze, <br>
Blinking at the lightning on the stormy days, <br>
Here to guard the forests from the Red Wolf s tongue <br>
I stay until they take me down when the fall snow comes.
",Robin Adair,<i>California District News Letter</i>,,,,,,1927,
excerpt003,"Most forest fires are discovered and handled in their early stages by fire guards. In these critical early stages, the judgement and competence of the Forest Service in fire control is largely measured by the judgement and competence the fire guard puts into his work. In a very real sense, the fire guard is the Forest Service at such times…",C.M. Granger,"Acting Chief, Forest Service",,,,,,1937,

excerpt005,"Considerable research and study have been made on the use of airplanes versus lookouts. The agencies that have made these studies generally agree that the most economical detection system is a combination of the two. As a general guide they recommend one lookout per 100,000 acres, with air detection supplementing the lookout during periods of bad burning conditions or after lightning storms.",<i>Handbook for Fire Lookouts</i>,National Park Service,,,,,,1958,
excerpt006,"<p>Is anything burning?</p>

<p>The sun itself! Dying<br>
Pooping out, exhausted<br>
Having produced brontosaurus, Heraclitus<br>
This rock, me,<br>
To no purpose<br>
I tell you anyway (as a kind of loving) . . .<br>
Flies & other insects come from miles around<br>
To listen<br>
I also address the rock, the heather,<br>
The alpine fir</p>

excerpt007,"Yes, for I’d thought, in June, hitchhiking up there to Skagit Valley in northwest Washington for my fire lookout job ‘When I get to the top of Desolation Peak and everybody leaves on mules and I’m alone I will come face to face with God or Tathagata and find out once and for all what the meaning of all the existence and suffering and going to and fro’ in vain’ but instead I’d come face to face with myself, no liquor, no drugs, no chance of faking it but face to face with ole Hateful Duluoz Me…”",Jack Kerouac,<i>Desolation Angles</i>,,,,,,1965,

excerpt010,"Some of the notable characters to spend a summer in this hellhole with a view like heaven included a fellow named Kerouac, who wrote a full-length book about angels and demons that would take someone higher than the peaks to be able to follow. Another, named Kachen, was born in Russia, fled to Manchuria, then to the North Cascades where he became a Desolation lookout for a time. Yet another disoriented soul from the big city wandered around the peak naked all one summer. Finally, there was the lad from Sweeden who wore straw sandals, sported a full-circle mandarin moustache, and chanted from a book on Oriental mysticism all day long … thinking he was Chinese.",Ray Kresek,<i>Fire Lookouts of the Northwest</i>,,,,,,1984,
excerpt011,"Nosing the wine, I picked out and inserted a cassette, and the tiny glass house was filled with a Bach cello solo. Outside the lightning flashed and a drizzle of rain ran down the panes. The warmth of the wine and the fire rose to my head. By the third glass I was slightly giddy, a cheap drunk on an empty stomach. The stark music was punctuated by the booms of thunder.",Doug Peacock,"""The Lookout""",,,,,,1990,
excerpt012,"Had lookouts been in existence in [Thoreau’s] time, he could have been an inspector, not of snowstorms, but thunderstorms. His life-long quest for the suitable vocation would have been satisfied, and perhaps he might have written yet another Walden-like book—casting stones at civilization from his glass house.",Don Scheese,"Henry David Thoreau, Fire Lookout""",,,,,,1990,
