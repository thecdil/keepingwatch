## About Keeping Watch

Keeping Watch is a geo-spatial narrative project that embeds oral history testimonies by former and current fire lookouts on a GIS interface. These stories were collected by Jack Kredell, Chris Lamb, and Michael Decker in the Summer of 2021 across the state of Idaho. 

The goal of this project is twofold: to create an online archive for this vital yet disappearing component of Idaho history and to reconceptualize the space  these firetowers define via the juxtaposition of the map's inherent grid and GIS structure, and the subjective experience of those who have, are, and will experience these places.

The towers are open ended in how they are active technology and ruin. They are essential and symbolic. They are *already-happened* and *yet-to-be*, their futures uncertain as the landscapes they watch over. 

## Funding and Supported

Keeping Watch was funded by a [University of Library Seed Grant](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/opportunities/fellowships/libseed.html) and its development was supported by the faculty and staff of the [Center for Digtial Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/).

A personal note from the project director: *This project is the result of a summer spent in the woods and mountains, and alongside some of the best fishing streams in the world. As important as this history is to tell, our time working on this project was undeniably fun. We spent the summer of 2021 hiking to towers, catching cutthroat and rainbow trout, and even running away from a wildfire. It was one of the best summers of my life, and I felt as if I, like the tower itself, became part of history--a small piece.*
