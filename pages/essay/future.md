## The Future

By Michael Decker

Beginning in the Frank Church Wilderness, Jack, Chris, and I have spent the last two weeks traveling across Idaho taking photos of fire lookouts and interviewing those who work on still active sites. We are beat up and tired, our skin is leathery, and our lips are cracking from the drastic shifts in elevation. 

We, along with my girlfriend, Kourtnie, who has driven down to the Lochsa country of central Idaho to meet us, are hiking to Diablo Peak where Bill Moore spends two weeks a year as a lookout. Like Pam, Bill runs a volunteer program for lookouts that provides an additional level of fire reduction and helps keep the tradition of lookouts alive.

Bill Moore is the son of the late Lochsa district ranger and activist Bud Moore, who implemented a _multiple-use_ policy in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Multiple-use policy aims to manage competing needs and values to achieve ecosystem health alongside human society’s economic demands. Bud was one of the first lookouts in this part of the country, having spent several seasons on McConnell Mountain which is just over the ridge from Diablo. 

The story goes that Bud began his tenure with the Forest Service as a lookout and smoke chaser. He was stationed at McConnell Mountain in 1935 where he stayed for several years and immediately found a flaw in the Forest Service’s fire watching approach at McConnell Mountain: during lightning storms, he was confined to a cabin below the tree line which had been outfitted to withstand strikes. Out of rocks, Bud constructed a small tower higher up that had a cupola design and where he would watch for strikes during summer storms. From this vantage point, he made notations about strike locations and improved his overall accuracy and effectiveness as a fire lookout. When the district ranger came to check on Bud, he was impressed with his design and ordered a fire lookout be built in place of the rock pile. 

Bud left the Selway-Bitterroot to fight in World War II but returned and became district ranger in the early-1950s. During this time, McConnell was an active lookout that helped to reinforce the Forest Service’s infamous 10 a.m. policy. All fires, the Forest Service proclaimed, were to be exterminated by 10 a.m. the following morning. However, enabled by the signing of The Wilderness Act of 1964, the Selway-Bitterroot became protected Wilderness, which meant that a new set of fire policies were put in place from total fire suppression to wildfire as prescribed burn.

In a sense, Bud always recognized that some of his policies, retrospectively, were harmful. This includes spraying DDT to kill pine beetles and wood worms and starving soils of nitrogen and amassing fuel loads that feed anthropogenic forest fires to this day. Regardless, Bud often admitted these shortcomings and proposed different modeling for management that imagined more ideal environmental futures. For example, Bud led the reintroduction of controlled burns in fire deficit areas in the Selway-Bitterroot. Many of his thoughts and actions can be found in his sprawling book _The Lochsa Story: Land Ethics in the Bitterroot Mountains_. Tellingly, this book was written a full decade prior to its publication (1996) because many of the ideas within it were not yet popularly accepted, and, as Bill points out, he refused to vanity publish.

In the end, lightning escaped from the sky and ignited a wildfire five miles from Bud’s old rock pile and three days later the now-decommissioned McConnell Mountain fire lookout burned down. <a href="https://keeping.onrender.com/items/mcconnel-mountain001.html" target="_blank">Bill once wrote</a> that Bud, who passed away in 2010, would not be sad because “the story is a lesson about the circle of life and death in the Wilderness world.”

“Bill!” I call out as the shape of Diablo’s lookout materializes through the ubiquitous wildfire smoke. I see a fluorescent work shirt make its way over a ridge and a pale hand wave howdy. Bill is a septuagenarian who moves slowly but confidently; it is the result of a life spent hiking and living in a big open country. He smiles an honest, crooked smile that, to me, is the stuff of life and makes me feel at home. He invites us up to the cabin and brews a pot of coffee that effortlessly creates hospitality, and which prompts conversation in the way only a pot of coffee shared among friends can.  

The tower is full of books and gear that lookouts have left over the years. The design of most towers is the same: a propane stove, small refrigerator, wooden framed bed, and shelving around the ceiling for holding canned goods and books. A map of the tower’s surrounding topography is attached to a wooden board that folds down from the ceiling above the bed, and that can be used in conjunction with the fire finder. Most of the tower’s belongings are somewhat antiquated; however, there are modern objects as well: a Garmin InReach on which I glanced a message asking Bill if he had been evacuated yet (as there are several fires burning near the tower), his iPhone that he uses to snap a portrait of our team, and a newer REI backpack near the bed. 

“Could you really quickly give us a three-sixty view here?” Chris begins the interview. Bill chuckles and points his finger to the east. 

“I’m not sure how to put it. We’re sitting on the ridge between the Selway drainage and the Lochsa drainage. You got Big Fog lakes up here in the fog or the smoke. You can just see the tail end of it. It’s about a mile long and has a sand bar at one end. Wonderful fishing. You come up over this ridgetop here, that’s Genette Mountain. You go down into Little Moose Crick and that’s Dead Elk Point right there. There’s a little low one called Footstool.  Go down this way and that’s Goat Lakes. Behind them is Wahoo Point and Battle Creek Ridge. That is all in what used to be the Nez Perce National Forest. It’s now the Clearwater-Nez. Then you go around this corner where the smoke is really heavy and that's Elbow Bend. Between Elbow Bend and that corner is a huge old-growth cedar grove that was written up in the National Geographic in 1935. That ridge that’s coming down like that is Maple Ridge. There’s a little mountain range called the Graves Range, and right out there is Graves Peak.”

As Bill describes the landscape, I imagine him oscillating his body from left to right, creating an arc of the horizon along an azimuth that traces a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree trajectory, and his tinted glasses all but revealing the squinting of one eye to identify the landmarks through an internalized parallax view. The other striking thing is that we cannot see any of these places that Bill talks about; the smoke is too thick for that. From the tower, the landscape appears as a white purgatory upon which nothing can be discerned; it is a _strange_ canvas which defamiliarizes the familiar. However, Bill is sure to point out that this smoke indicates something natural is occurring on the landscape, and that the high-visibility days of his and Bud’s early time as fire lookouts was the result of “Smokey the Bear'' or a euphemism for the Forest Service's 10 a.m. policy. 

We sit around for hours talking about Bill’s stories, and he goes into extensive detail about his father’s work in the district. He has interesting ways of pronouncing words; Diablo, for instance, is pronounced “die-ablo.” I also notice though that there is a childlike essence to Bill. Though time has aged him, I have no problem imagining him young, and when he talks about Bud, he always refers to him as “Pops.” Bill celebrates his father, but there is a pain in his voice that reminds me of the “circle” he uses to describe the old McConnell lookout. It is obvious how much he misses Bud who also represents a past way of life and attachment to the land. The act of maintaining lookout structures and lookout volunteer programs is an attempt, among other things, to keep this attachment alive. Storytellers like Bill, and the rest of us, really, see the world through an aggregation of experience. Places do not, to the human, exist in isolation of memory, and perhaps except for the Nez Perce who were born from this land, Bill and Bud are as infused with the landscape as anyone. 

In _The Lochsa Story_, Bud tells the story of himself as a young trapper on his first solo trip into the Bitterroots. Near a small lake in the Valley of the Brushy Fork, Bud comes face-to-face with a large grizzly bear, a species that was already on its way out in the area. Frozen with fear each stare into the face of the other and the human and bear come to an understanding as Bud says, that “[t]he forest belonged to the bear, but the meadow was mine; so I camped at its edge beneath thick-limbed spruces that would shield my blanket from the frost.” This confrontation becomes central to the land ethics that Bud presents in his book, and how he frames multiple-use theory as a viable management path forward; the idea that he and the Grizzly can come to an agreement to live out their distinct, but still intertwined, existences becomes, like  democracy, a challenging idealization that is critical for the survival of both human and bear. 

Some say that the fire lookout gives those who can stay on them a _long view_, not just in-terms of a twenty-five-mile radius around the tower, but a view that looks deep into the past and future; and like the tower’s view, Bud believed that the remnants of his encounter with the bear–“[his] boot prints mingled with the grizzly tracks on the trail”—say something about where it is we have come from, and where it is we are going, like the light of a distant star glimpsed from a lookout during the night, at once happening and already having happened.

Lookouts have inherent contradictions and blur many binaries like old and new, civilization and wilderness, self and other. This is because lookouts are the collectivity of many agencies, private interests, and individuals. For instance, we often live with the consequences of the past, and, through one historical lens, lookouts are beacons of colonial violence such as indigenous erasure and pernicious management like the 10 A.M. Policy. However, lookouts have also served as contemplative settings for some of the most influential environmental voices in American history like Norman Maclean, Ed Abbey, and Gary Snyder. Lookouts became a refuge for those who wanted to escape many of the issues that colonialism (the same colonialism that built lookouts) gave birth to. This is their paradox.

Most succinctly, you can view the lookout through the paradigm shifts of American land ethics and policy alterations over the last century (or so). For example, wilderness once meant a wild and hostile place. Hiking until very recently meant to "sneak" or to "creep along." To watch from a lookout, likewise, first meant to watch over valuable stands of timber (on <a href="https://keeping.onrender.com/items/no-business-lookout.html" target="_blank">TPA land</a> this is still true) for the purposes of suppressing fire, and yet now we may consider lookouts a place to feel connected to the land when remote technology threatens this relationship.  

A last word on lookouts. Lookout means both building and human. The significance of one is inextricably linked to the other. Bud Moore came up in the Forest Service at the same time as the lookout structure. Both Bud and the lookout helped implement many of the early forestry practices that have become obsolete due to better science in recent years. The lookout became a literary refuge in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's where writers began to use them as sources of inspiration. Similarly, Bud wrote his sprawling book, _Lochsa Story_, sometime toward the end of the twentieth century and advocated for a more nuanced approach to managing the needs of people _and_ ecosystems. The lookout structure now remains commonly in view of wilderness boundaries and serves a mostly observational function (early lookouts would locate _and_ fight fires); in line with this observational function, Bud left a legacy of fire tolerance and advocated for the return of fire on wilderness landscapes. Lookouts (both human and structure), in this way, reveal not only the historical arch of wilderness and other forms of public lands, but also the built environments that their functionality is shaped to, including roads, bridges, and towns. Their distribution of use and disuse is strongly correlated to changing economic and cultural values that shape public discourse and thus landscapes. The story of lookouts is the story of American land ethics accross the United States.

We thank Bill for his hospitality and for sharing stories about his time on Diablo Peak and of his father. Our camera and recording gear packed, we headed down the trail. I was euphoric on the hike down, thinking about my last month traveling to different cabins and towers, and the feeling of having my own lookout and fire finder. I remember the ruins of Chicken Peak, and the uncanniness of the podium upon which once sat a fire finder identical to the one I used on Sundance. Most of all, I think about the intersection of all these things, and the culmination of a land ethic that is rooted in a deep sense of space and place and accounts for large stretches of time. Bud seems to have taken on the project accounting for the past, present, and future of the Lochsa and Bitterroot country. 

Driving away from Diablo’s trailhead, I look at the small roadside creeks that are dry from drought. Bud wrote extensively about the impact of roads on watersheds. I am traveling along a troubled history as an orange diamond and a gate appear. We inch the car past and get out. “AREA CLOSED DUE TO WILDFIRE. NO ACCESS.” Below the sign are current conditions of the nearby Lolo fires that according to this map have grown. Back in the car, I turn around and watch the sign fade to white as the tower feels more like a dream I have just woken from.
