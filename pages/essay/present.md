## Present Day

By Michael Decker

In the Department of Lands office in Nordman, Idaho, Pam, who runs a volunteer fire lookout program for the Priest Lake fire district in northern Idaho, tosses me a forest green shirt with “fire” printed in large white letters on the front. I met Pam two weeks ago on [Sundance Lookout](https://keeping.onrender.com/items/sundance-mountain.html) in the Selkirk Mountains. My colleagues, Jack Kredell and Chris Lamb, and I had recently interviewed her for Keeping Watch, an archive of interviews with current and former fire lookouts.

A week ago, Pam called me because an unexpected opening had become available on the tower and she wanted to offer me and my dog, Trout, the chance to work for a few days as a lookout. She thought it would be a good opportunity for someone studying lookouts to be one. I jumped at the opportunity, as it would be good for the project because of this tower’s unique history: Sundance Lookout was the site of a lightning strike that ignited the [1967 Sundance Fire](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_int/int_rp056.pdf) and burned fifty-thousand acres and killed two firefighters. The fire was exceptional by mid-twentieth century standards because it made an anomalous run of sixteen miles in nine hours. It was the focus of numerous studies on unpredictable fire behavior thereafter, although burns of such severity and unpredictability have become common as unprecedented fuel loads are ignited by the burgeoning effects of climate change. These days, many wildfires are as severe as the Sundance Fire.

This increase in wildfire is exacerbated by the continued settlement of areas inside the _wildland urban interface_: an area where developing human settlement meets what the U.S. Fire Administration calls “unoccupied land.” These homes are, unsurprisingly, at a higher risk of being destroyed by wildfire, which prompts complex fire reduction efforts by both private and government agencies. Idaho has seen a dramatic population increase in the last decade which has created socio-economic changes that have priced out long-time renters and inflamed the tempers of locals who think Idaho is being _Californianized,_ a quasi-colonial act by which comparatively liberal policies proliferate in response to an increasing population.  

The growing wealth inequality along the wildland urban interface also explains the frustrations many Idahoans have with richer and often part-time residents with second homes in the state who typically receive more firefighting resources, often bankrolled by insurance companies trying to protect expensive assets. These new arrivals have begun constructing their dream homes, and in the Priest Lake fire district most of these homes are built near the lake shore with large adjacent swaths of _unoccupied_ land. Many fire lookouts, like Sundance, are either placed on or near the wildland urban interface or overlooking valuable stands of timber. 

Fire’s direct correlation to human migration coupled with economic and environmental factors, our team thinks, makes the fire lookout an ideal location to study changing human perceptions of space and place, and to think about how our relationship to it shapes our material reality. There is also a rich history of forest management in the American West that can be documented, not to mention the individual stories about the people who _tried_ to leave society behind and live at the edge of human civilization on the interface of occupied and unoccupied land. 

Pam’s boss, John, slides a map across the table. It shows the topography surrounding Priest Lake and how the Selkirk Mountains make a skinny valley that crosses the Canadian border. Lightning bolts show where several strikes occurred a week ago during a June thunderstorm. These strikes are concerning because Idaho is in the early stages of its worst drought in several decades. I will be on the tower during what is projected to be the [hottest recorded temperatures ever in the Northwest](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/2021-northwest-heat-dome-causes-impacts-and-future-outlook): one-hundred-and-thirteen degrees Fahrenheit, tomorrow. Pam and John tell me to watch for sleeper fires at these strike locations. _Sleepers_ are burns that do not immediately consume large amounts of fuel, but instead sit dormant and produce periodic smoke events before erupting into a larger fire, sometimes up to two weeks after initial ignition.

I shake their hands and thank Pam for the opportunity. She is smiling and adjusts her baseball cap covering a tuft of white hair and tells me to have fun and to drink alcohol in moderation because of the altitude. The Idaho Department of Lands has given me a truck to use. Even though my Subaru has all-wheel-drive, its four-cylinder engine is underpowered for the slope up to the tower, and its clearance is questionable. I laugh and open the door of the truck as Trout jumps up on the seat. I drive away from the government building with the AC blasting. Around 9 a.m., the temperature is approaching ninety degrees Fahrenheit.

I am setting out on a pilgrimage to a temple high in the mountains like in the book of Exodus where prophets tried to see God in places that were physically closer to heaven, although, if Heaven is real, it is probably not located in space or time. I think of Matsuo Bashō, the sixteenth century Japanese poet who traveled into Northern Japan after his house burned down. He sought out temples and other religious and political iconography as inspiration for writing haikus. The tower, after all, is a temple to the lookouts who staff them. In the spring, Jack and Chris had interviewed [two former students of Naropa University](https://keeping.onrender.com/items/pilot-peak001.html) where Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, who carried on the tradition that Bashō helped make famous by writing haikus, famously taught principles of Buddhism. 

On the road to Sundance, I look at my Idaho Department of Lands shirt, the government truck, and a black highway leading me like a river to a tower high in the Selkirk Mountains. Below me already are the constructed dreams of America’s wealthy. It feels _economical_ as the truck kicks up dust and I climb the poorly maintained service road; the all-terrain tires tested by sharp rocks while the undercarriage passes narrowly over deep ruts and boulders. I forget to shift into four-wheel drive and, briefly, the truck’s tires spin free on the steep slope. Trout sits up abruptly and observes the situation. _Don’t worry, Bud._

The burn scar is the first thing I notice when cresting the peak of Sundance Mountain and despite vegetation from over half-a-century of regeneration, its appearance is noticeably stunted compared to nearby mountain slopes. The heat is thick like syrup as I close the truck door and wave to the lookout being relieved from duty. Her two dogs run to the edge of the fifty-foot-tall tower. Trout looks at them uninterested. There is no barking. The other lookout waves back.

Inside the tower I inspect my new home which has a dish sink, propane stove, and a small refrigerator in the corner. Gas lamps hang on the wall above a small bed that I throw my sleeping bag over. I step onto the deck and see smoke obfuscating mountains to the east and north of me. With aerial surveillance taking place, I question how much my antiquated role is necessary. I crack a beer and drag my camp chair to the deck. Trout sits next to me. Distantly, I hear construction equipment hoisting beams and trestles. Is that, just maybe, the pressurized release of a nail gun?

In the center of the tower is a podium on which sits a large steel table holding the Osborne Fire Finder. Lookouts use this device to precisely locate fires. It has a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree alidade surrounding a map with the fire tower at its center. The Osborne is used to call in the location of a smoke using degrees and minutes that are communicated to a fire dispatcher over the two-way radio system installed below the podium.

The Osborne Fire Finder was primarily manufactured between the years 1920 and 1935 by Leopold and Stevens, a telescope manufacturing company, which thereafter also produced replacement parts until 1975, halting production because new fire detection methods had more-or-less made the fire finder obsolete. After a substantial increase in wildfires in the late-90s and early-00s, the federal government contracted with a new manufacturer, San Dimas and Technology Center, to resupply fire lookouts with Osbornes, and to produce replacement parts as needed.

Why did federal and state governments and timber protection agencies (the latter usually funded by private logging companies) decide to bring back the human-staffed fire lookout? I can think of many reasons why we _should_ have them. Maybe, we could staff these towers with students from underserved school districts who historically have little access to _wild_ places. I use “wild” according to the wording of the Wilderness Act of 1964 as “a place where man is but a visitor […]” Agencies could pay a rate suitable for high school or college students and give them the opportunity to live and work in beautiful scenic places, and thus increase public attachment to wilderness. As for management, shouldn’t we be physically present in the places we are managing rather than making decisions from a God’s-eye-view? _What is lost_ we asked the lookout, they replied, _a sense of continuity_.

To my East is a checkerboard of logging sites on state forest land, to my north is the batholith of the Selkirk Crest, and to my west are the towns of Coolin and Nordman. I close my eyes for a moment and open them. Briefly, there is no Idaho Department of Lands, no Forest Service, no Bureau of Land Management, no Idaho Forest Group, no Jack Kredell, no Chris Lamb, no Michael Decker.     

Through the window, a breeze sneaks in. It’s about 15 degrees cooler on the tower than in the valley. The bear grass makes the air smell sweet, and the last patches of snow are melting at a perceptible rate. There is a pine snag on a nearby ridge to my southeast standing in an otherwise healthy forest, and below it the highwater mark of evening inches closer. I fixate on the steadiness of this pull between night and day. The sun’s geometry positions the tree at the fulcrum of light and dark. I glance at my phone: 7:38 p.m.

The sun dips behind the mountains. The evening neon radiates through bars of smoke rising above the Selkirks and a stratum of cosmic ozone and geology slowly dims into the night sky. Venus appears to my West. The universe flickers on. The Milky Way swirls like a parking lot oil stain as I lie in bed reading William Least Heat-Moon’s _Blue Highways._

{% include feature/image.html objectid="sundance-mountain002" width="50" %} 

_Blue Highways’_ premise is that a young Heat-Moon has lost his English lectureship and his marriage is dissolving. Devastated, he sets out like Matsuo Bashō on a pilgrimage, and designs a circular journey—like the Uroboros—that travels from New England and through the southwestern United States, into the Pacific Northwest, and veers east again. The only discernible destination is where he began. The trip is taken in a green Astrovan that he names Ghost Dancing after the Native American ritual which foretold the return of departed spirits and the end of colonial expansion.

Making his way through the American Southwest, Heat-Moon reflects on the smells and nuances of the central Nevada desert. Its lonesomeness makes him consider the Latin root of the English word _vacation_, which is _vacare_ (meaning “to be empty”). He uses the open space to infuse himself with impressions of the landscape and foster a connection to the non-interior world. To see himself out there in the desert and merge with the interstitial absence of the Nevada landscape, and finally to be “absorbed” by it.           

Heat-Moon looks out of Ghost Dancing and sees himself reflected in the pellucidity of the van window, transposed onto the desert. Quoting Whitman, he describes “…the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet….” Seeing yourself as connected to and part of the exterior world is a common first step toward an ethical worldview that accounts for the fundamentally entangled nature of the world and cosmos, but this also means that one must see a reflection of themselves in the face of the Other to care for them. I would like to imagine the landscape of non-self in a different, less familiar way.  

There is something innate in human psychology that causes this transposition of self onto non-self and is likely due to mutations in our brains that occurred around the cognitive revolution. The earliest human art ever discovered is a forty-thousand-year-old ivory statue of a lion with the body of a human, which is an example of early homo-sapiens ability to manipulate the material world and to render it, creatively, in ways that do not exist, at least in a literal sense. We imagine new realities; realities like the one I am helping perpetuate in which wildland fire is controlled for human purposes and that is symbolized by a bear who stands erect and wears clothes like a human.

I put down _Blue Highways_ and turn off my headlamp, get out of my sleeping bag, and walk to the window. Trout briefly lifts his head but falls back asleep. Between the inside of the cabin and the night sky, the windows and propane lamp transpose my face onto the universe. I walk to the deck and suddenly all that remains is black plasma where my face was.

I open my eyes up on Sundance to a white sun, drink coffee from my percolator, and feed Trout his kibble. There is not much to do today, which is a perk of the job. Trout manages to run around the deck a few times without falling to his death, and I scan for signs of fire. Inside, I open a can of corned beef hash and sip my coffee, journal, and try to make sense of my surroundings. A copy of William Cronon’s edited collection _Uncommon Ground_ unfolds in my hands. 

Cronon makes the argument that all wilderness is in fact a human creation. I think ahead to my upcoming trip into the Frank Church Wilderness with Jack and Chris, and how that landscape, though pristine in appearance, has been shaped in profound ways by humans for thousands of years. Around this tower is a triad of human settlement, managed forest, and proposed wilderness. I do not know how to distinguish the three. Where does human influence stop, and where does nature begin? Cronon proposes a different take on wilderness, one which “[learns] to honor the wild—learning to remember and acknowledge the autonomy of the other….” With each act of use we must deeply consider our personal impact on a place. Cronon thinks there is a way to use nature that does not diminish it. The first step, I believe, hinges on that beautiful phrase he writes: “the other.” Which is something that demands recognition.  

In “Anecdote of the Jar”, Wallace Stevens writes, “I placed a jar in Tennessee / and round it was, upon a hill. / It made the slovenly wilderness / surround that hill.” Stevens wrote this poem in 1919 when the illusion of wilderness was easier to imagine, and when humans were beginning to revere nature as a sanctuary and not to be feared. Today, I am unsure where the jar ends and where it begins. Does the “slovenly wilderness” surround the jar or does the jar surround the wilderness? Therefore, the act of looking, I think to myself, is more important than ever, and why these lookouts are still important. They are placed, quite intentionally, on an interface between human civilization and unsettled lands, between the meadow and the forest, and I take it upon myself to recognize the shaking of the great batholith before me. I stare through the Osborne fire finder and imagine this place without any grid lines, without the intellect and philosophy of humans. It is just a place, and I am at the edge of it.
