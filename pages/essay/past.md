## The Past

By Michael Decker

Jack, Chris, and I have driven into the heart of the Frank Church Wilderness, seventy miles from McCall, Idaho along a dirt road, stopping only to fish the Salmon River which early settlers dubbed “the river of no return.” Drifting my caddis along the water, I think of the ghosts of the Tukudeka, a mysterious mountain tribe of Shoshone-Bannock Native Americans, colloquially known as the Sheepeaters.

We are making the twenty-mile hike from Mosquito Ridge to the Tukudeka namesake, Sheepeater Mountain, which is home to one of the most remote fire lookouts in the world. This place's common name The Frank Church, or usually just The Church, was given after one of the key architects of the Wilderness Act of 1964, Idaho Senator Frank Church. He remains one of the most prolific progressive voices ever in Idaho politics, and one of the most accomplished establishment environmentalists in American history. As the floor speaker for the passage of the Wilderness Act, his key role in its drafting and signing into law helped create this wilderness area. 

The Church is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the lower-forty-eight states, comprising roughly two-and-a-half-million acres of land. Being out here reveals a deep history across geologic time. Yet, urban landscapes are the antecedent of wilderness, as we know it today, and not the other way around. 

Land preservation in America, specifically in the West, was itself a reaction to many of the social woes that accompanied industrialism beginning sometime in the nineteenth century. In his 1924 essay "Machines and Emotions," Bertrand Russell argues that technological proliferation brought about subsequent increases in social violence (Russell was of course writing shortly after World War I). "Many men" he says "would cease to desire war if they had opportunities to risk their lives in alpine climbing." Places like The Church were designed as a refuge from many of the same problems (like war) created by belief systems that had diminished wilderness in the first place. 

Bob Marshall, another key architect of the Wilderness Act of 1964, and the founder of <a href="https://www.wilderness.org/" target="_blank">The Wilderness Society</a>, writes in his essay, "The Problem with Wilderness" (a title similar to Cronon's aforementioned work), that wilderness should be established as a solution to the deleterious influence of urbanity. Directly quoting Russell, Marshall correlates technology with a deteriorating moral fabric and positions wilderness as a counterbalance. Without intervention, he claimed, wild spaces, which "[preserve] as nearly as possible the primitive environment," and their many edifying qualities, would disappear entirely before the end of the twentieth century.

From Mosquito Ridge, the Salmon River rushes five thousand feet below and high mountain wildflowers sway in the warm, pressurized wind. On a ridge above us, Chicken Peak must be the most unique cabin in the entire state of Idaho with its prominent roof and bright orange paint; the neon coloring helped pilots navigate over empty swaths of terrain before GPS technology. Chicken Peak is the halfway point between the Mosquito Ridge trailhead and Sheepeater Lookout. We have not been given a straight answer about its history but have gathered that it was built in the 1940s and abandoned in either the 60s or 70s due to funding cuts.

Inside, the floor is collapsing around an intact podium upon which the fire finder once sat. On this podium are the initials of lovers collected over the years. Jack carves JK + MM, and I take out my pocketknife and carve MD + KW with a heart around it. 

"Oh, shit, smoke," says Jack. I turn around and stare out of the smashed windows, my gaze directed in a very particular way, and see a plume of smoke rising from behind a ridge. We agree to keep an eye on it and not hike any further. The fire appears to be coming from across the Salmon River, but we would, foolishly, be going closer to it if we continued our current route. Jack says he has a friend named Andy who is an expert with InciWeb, which is a website with information about active wildfires. We send a message using my Garmin InReach. _This is Jack. We are on Chicken Peak in view of a wildfire east of Dixie. No danger to us currently. Could you get us some info on it?_

Hours pass as we watch this plume grow into a cloud and banter back and forth about our options. For a moment, the sun bursts through the smoke and beams a kaleidoscopic refraction. “Look,” says Chris, and suddenly, I am compelled back inside the deteriorating tower. I step across the floorboards, careful, so as not to trip. The panes where the windows once were make a frame around the smoke and hold the plume in place as if it were a painting. 

Standing at the fire finder, my hands rest on the podium and prepare to maneuver the alidade. I close one eye and look through the crosshairs to sight in _my_ smoke.  After all these years, there is still a pull; my gaze is directed in a very particular way and for a specific purpose.

I feel different inside the cabin than outside. The framing of the fire makes the difference. Inside, with my hands on the podium, I feel a sense of safety and order; the window frames the fire and thus controls it. Outside, I feel disoriented and out of control. The twinned histories of the human and non-human world are at odds with each other here. The cabin is at once being reclaimed and yet still maintains the capacity to conceptualize the landscape in human terms. 

“What do you think?” I ask the boys. “I guess even if there’s a five percent possibility that it’s dangerous, which is probably what we’re looking at, we should turn around,” Jack replies. I can tell that he is annoyed by me and Chris who are much more afraid of the fire spreading past the river than he is. Chis continually affirms that he is also nervous and that it would be unwise to continue hiking in the direction of the fire. Andy hasn’t responded yet, but I know Garmin satellite messages can have a delay and we could be waiting for several hours for information. 

In the spring, I interviewed a writer named Don Scheese who had lived and worked in the Frank Church as a fire lookout in the 1980s. He was stationed on Ruffneck Lookout close to the town of Stanley, Idaho. After eighteen seasons as a fire lookout, Scheese wrote a book about his experiences called _Mountains of Memory_. In his memoir, he defines landscape as a “modified space” which is the result of changes made to the land by humans. To Scheese, it was the people who lived in landscapes “especially the various inhabitants of the Frank Church over Millennia,'' who created them through their needs and desire. It was them, Scheese says, “who interest me the most.”

I notice something hidden in the dirt. It is a small button from a pair of Levis jeans. I pick it up and examine it. The metal is degraded enough that it could be twenty, even thirty, years old. Perhaps it was dropped while someone struggled with their trousers in the 1980s, and at the same time, Don Scheese sat on Ruffneck Peak looking out over the same landscape that I am now watching over. I clasp the button tightly and slide it into my pocket. 

My Garmin rings and announces Andy’s response that comes through in limited character segments: 

_Planned Actions: “Today, Aviation and ground resources are continuing structure protection work and improving the roads and fuel breaks near the community.”_

_Projected Incident Activity: “The fire has continued to burn actively and spread in all directions, and fire managers are anticipating that it will continue today under current conditions.”_

_Also, an hour ago they posted an Area Closure for the Dixie Jumbo Area._

_Looks like there might be another fire a little west of Dixie near Buffalo Hump._

_From InciWeb: “The Dixie Jumbo Fire is located 40 miles southeast of Grangeville, Idaho and 15 miles south of Elk City, Idaho. It is_

_Located on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest Red River Ranger District. It was detected on the afternoon of July 5, 2021.”_

Our decision is made; the fire is uncontained and spreading in all directions, and even though there is a river and a ridgeline between it and our destination, we would be foolish not to turn around. Sheepeater remains a mystery. Packing my bag, I take out my binoculars, and stare at the lookout on a ridge that is obscured by smoke, just out of reach.
