## The Past

_By Michael Decker_

Jack, Chris, and I have driven into the heart of the Frank Church Wilderness, seventy miles from McCall, Idaho along a dirt road, stopping only to fish the Salmon River which early settlers dubbed “the river of no return.” Drifting my caddis along the water, I think of the ghosts of the Tukudeka, a mysterious mountain tribe of Shoshone-Bannock Native Americans, colloquially known as the Sheepeaters.

We are making the twenty-mile hike from Mosquito Ridge to the Tukudeka namesake, Sheepeater Mountain, which is home to one of the most remote fire lookouts in the world. This place's common name The Frank Church, or usually just The Church, was given after one of the key architects of the Wilderness Act of 1964, Idaho Senator Frank Church. He remains one of the most prolific progressive voices ever in Idaho politics, and one of the most accomplished establishment environmentalists in American history. As the floor speaker for the passage of the Wilderness Act, his key role in its drafting and signing into law helped create this wilderness area. 

We woke up this morning on Big Creek, a main tributary of the Salmon River, and drove up a rugged road to the Mosquito Ridge trailhead. On the way, we pass the ruins of mining towns and go through a small creek. We have taken Chris’s 1996 4Runner that has a failing differential and overheats periodically because we fitted the wrong filter to it when changing the oil before we left. There is no auto parts store for a hundred miles, so we just add oil we bought from an old man on the side of the road. 

The road narrows and we pull over at a shallow divot. Loading our packs, I read the trailhead sign and notice that there are no other hiker census cards in the wooden Forest Service box. There is a laminated sign that announces the official boundary of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. 

The term wilderness is deceptively unstable. It is a noun that functions like an adjective. Older mentions of wilderness often referred to something’s wilderness quality or used the indefinite article like in “a bog” or “a city.” It is only very recently that we have “The Frank Church Wilderness.” Thus, it is important to think of wilderness not only as a setting but also as a construct. As postmodern historian William Cronon asserts in his essay "The Trouble with Wilderness", "Far from being the one place on earth that stands apart from humanity ... [wilderness] is quite profoundly a human creation – indeed the creation of very particular human cultures at very particular moments in human history."

The fire lookout’s relationship to wilderness seems obvious. They do, after all, oversee such areas, or are at least adjacently located to them. It is only by elucidating wilderness both as place _and_ concept though that this relationship is fully understood. Wilderness boundaries established through legislation are fixed, whereas the concept of wilderness is less so. 

Far from the modern perception of wilderness, early American colonizers brought with them the European fear and hatred of wilderness which they believed impeded human progress. Tellingly, Andrew Jackson said in his 1830 inaugural address that “what good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished with the improvements which art can devise or industry execute.” However, very quickly by the end of that same century, as Roderick Nash points out in his tome _Wilderness and the American Mind_ “modern man [felt] as insecure and confused in urban settings as he once felt in the forests among the wild beasts.” 

Further, Americans began ascribing the same aesthetic value to wilderness as to the Jacksonian _art and industry_. Bob Marshall, founder of The Wilderness Society, in his essay “The Problem of the Wilderness” (a similar title to Cronon’s “The Trouble with Wilderness”) says “One looks from outside at works of art and architecture, listens from outside to music or poetry. But when one looks at and listens to the wilderness, he is encompassed by his experience of beauty, lives in the midst of the esthetic universe.” By the inception of fire lookouts, there was a full-blown battle over the meaning of wilderness in both thought and in practice. 

Two wings of environmental thought were crystalizing in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that still frame the contemporary wilderness paradigm. Conservationists (_sustainable_ forest use for economic purposes) and preservationists (wilderness non-interventionism) split from one another around the time that lookouts were first being built and utilized for the protection of forest "crops." Pinchot and the conservationists, aided by the New Deal's Civilian Conservation Corps, built thousands of fire lookouts, including Chicken Peak (1930) and Sheepeater Mountain Lookout (1934). These lookouts were built with the sole purpose of negating the wilderness condition through systematic fire suppression. The preservationists, led by John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and Howard Zahniser, on the other hand fought legal battles over the preservation of Yosemite’s Hetch Hetchy Valley, Dinosaur National Monument, and the Grand Canyon, which led to the ratification of The Wilderness Act in 1964.

The creation of wilderness areas such as The Church directly correlates with the decline of fire lookouts. After all, there is no reason for a human made structure in what is legally defined as a place “where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” However, fire lookouts sometime in the middle of the twentieth century become endowed with a similar scarcity as wilderness, and a different, less utilitarian gaze begins to be cast from them. As Aldo Leopold once said of wilderness, "only when the end of the thing is in sight do we discover that the thing is valuable."

Writers like Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, Edward Abbey, and Wallace Stegner staffed lookouts in the 1950’s and 60’s. Gary Snyder, rather than writing of the official management purposes of lookouts, “[sits] cross-legged, in the practical and traditional posture of a Buddhist meditation.” Jack Kerouac, too, rather than encountering wildfire per se, had “instead come face to face with [himself].” 

By the 1980’s it was clear that the real cultural significance of lookouts rested not in their utilitarian purpose, but rather in their connection to human wilderness. In the definitive lookout “bible” written by Ray Kresek and published in 1987, _Fire Lookouts of the Northwest_, he asks “Where have all the lookouts gone?” Rather than evoking nostalgia for antiquated management practices, Kresek outlines the troubles one returns to in civilization, that “his buddy had run his car into a tree, his family was sore because he didn’t write all summer, and his girlfriend was going steady with someone else.” Instead, the lookout wishes to “return to his summer job in the wilderness atop Mount Sentinel … only to be told that his lookout was no longer there. They burned it down last fall.” 

Most often, lookout life embodied not the clear segregation of wilderness or civilization, but rather the blending of the two. For instance, in "The Lookout" by Doug Peacock, he pours a bottle of 1970 Les Forts while listening to a Bach Cello solo "[feeling] like Captain Nemo in my mountain top glass house" as a violent thunderstorm passes over. Suddenly, someone radios him to confirm his official pack-out date. He then tries to regain his "sense of solitude." 

In The Church, only Sheepeater Lookout remains staffed, and recently only for emergency purposes. As we climb the Mosquito Ridge trail, the outline of Sheepeater Peak, briefly, comes into view. Last month, we interviewed a lookout enthusiast named Richard Holm who also restores lookouts in his spare time. In his 2009 book, _Points of Prominence_, Holm explains that Sheepeater exists at the edge of lookout evolution, and that those who staff it are primarily "fire monitors" who make sure that fire does not cross the wilderness boundary. This new functionality is of interest to Holm though who points out that the average fire size has grown from just a few thousand acres to "100,000 acre fires [becoming] common place." Such an increase is evidence that the same human conditions exasperating fire in National Forests, TPA lands, private property, and National Parks, are present in wilderness areas as well.

From Mosquito Ridge, the Salmon River rushes five thousand feet below me and high mountain wildflowers sway in the warm, pressurized wind. On a ridge above us, Chicken Peak must be the most unique fire lookout in the entire state of Idaho with its prominent roof and bright orange paint; the neon coloring helped pilots navigate over empty swaths of terrain before GPS technology. Chicken Peak is the halfway point between the Mosquito Ridge trailhead and Sheepeater Lookout.

During the years 1937 and '38, Myron "Skook" McCoy and his wife, Aloha, staffed Chicken Peak. Aloha claimed that this lookout took on more lightning than any other lookout she ever staffed, and that "the electricity literally dripped off the grounding wires." I can easily see why; Chicken Peak, unlike some mountains that gradually marry into other peaks, is very exposed and likely susceptible to lightning strikes. I bet this cabin rocks like a boat during storms.

Inside, the floor is collapsing around an intact podium upon which the fire finder once sat. On this podium are the initials and corresponding dates collected over the years which creates a palimpsestic visualization of collective experience. Jack carves JK + MM, and I take out my pocketknife and carve MD + KW with a heart around it. 

"Oh, shit, smoke," says Jack. I turn around and stare out of the smashed windows, my gaze directed in a very particular way, and see a plume of smoke rising from behind a ridge. We agree to keep an eye on it and not hike any further. The fire appears to be coming from across the Salmon River, but we would, foolishly, be going closer to it if we continued our current route. Jack says he has a friend named Andy who is an expert with InciWeb, which is a website with information about active wildfires. We send a message using my Garmin InReach. 

_This is Jack. We are on Chicken Peak in view of a wildfire east of Dixie. No danger to us currently. Could you get us some info on it?_

Hours pass as we watch this plume grow into a cloud and banter back and forth about our options. For a moment, the sun bursts through the smoke and beams a kaleidoscopic refraction. “Look,” says Chris, and suddenly, I am compelled back inside the deteriorating tower. I step across the floorboards, careful, so as not to trip. The panes where the windows once were makes a frame around the smoke and holds the plume in place as if it were a painting. 

Standing at the fire finder, my hands rest on the podium and prepare to maneuver the alidade. I close one eye and look through the crosshairs to sight in _my_ smoke.  After all these years, there is still a pull; my gaze is directed in a very particular way and for a specific purpose. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="chicken-peak004" width="50" %} 

I feel different inside the cabin than outside. The framing of the fire makes a difference. Inside, with my hands on the podium, I feel a sense of safety and order; the window frames the fire and thus controls it. Outside, I feel disoriented and less in control. The twinned histories of the human and non-human world are at odds with each other here. The cabin is at once being reclaimed and yet still maintains the capacity to conceptualize the landscape in human terms. 

“What do you think?” I ask Jack and Chris. “I guess even if there’s a five percent possibility that it’s dangerous, which is probably what we’re looking at, we should turn around,” Jack replies. I can tell that he is annoyed by me and Chris who are much more afraid of the fire spreading past the river than he is. Chis continually affirms that he is also nervous and that it would be unwise to continue hiking in the direction of the fire. 

My Garmin rings and announces Andy’s response that comes through in limited character segments: 

_Planned Actions: “Today, Aviation and ground resources are continuing structure protection work and improving the roads and fuel breaks near the community.”_

_Projected Incident Activity: “The fire has continued to burn actively and spread in all directions, and fire managers are anticipating that it will continue today under current conditions.”_

_Also, an hour ago they posted an Area Closure for the Dixie Jumbo Area._

_Looks like there might be another fire a little west of Dixie near Buffalo Hump._


_From InciWeb: “The Dixie Jumbo Fire is located 40 miles southeast of Grangeville, Idaho and 15 miles south of Elk City, Idaho. It is_

_Located on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest Red River Ranger District. It was detected on the afternoon of July 5, 2021.”_

Our decision is made; the fire is uncontained and spreading in all directions, and even though there is a river and a ridgeline between it and our destination, we would be foolish not to turn around.

In the spring, I interviewed a writer named Don Scheese who had lived and worked in the Frank Church as a fire lookout in the 1980s. He was stationed on Ruffneck Lookout close to the town of Stanley, Idaho. After eighteen seasons as a fire lookout, Scheese wrote a book about his experiences called _Mountains of Memory_. In his memoir, he defines landscape as a “modified space” which is the result of changes made to the land by humans. To Scheese, it was the people who lived in landscapes “especially the various inhabitants of the Frank Church over Millennia,'' who created them through their needs and desire. It was them, Scheese says, “who interest me the most.”

I notice something hidden in the dirt. It is a small button from a pair of Levis jeans. I pick it up and examine it. The metal is degraded enough that it could be twenty, even thirty, years old. Perhaps it was dropped while someone struggled with their trousers in the 1980s, and at the same time, Don Scheese sat on Ruffneck Peak looking out over the same landscape that I am now watching over. I clasp the button tightly and slide it into my pocket before heading back to the Mosquito Ridge trailhead.
