I sip my coffee down to a black residue as we start packing our cameras and prepare to head back down the trail. The smoke, I think, has gotten worse since we arrived. Bill gestures vaguely out toward McConnell Mountain where his dad had worked. In the end, lightning ignited a wildfire five miles from Bud’s old rock pile and three days later the now-decommissioned McConnell Mountain fire lookout burned down. <a href="https://keeping.onrender.com/items/mcconnel-mountain001.html" target="_blank">Bill wrote</a> that Bud, who passed away in 2010, would not be sad because “the story is a lesson about the circle of life and death in the Wilderness world.”

Bud’s personal land ethic emphasized that no human alteration to the land is without consequences. Any changes to an ecosystem will have unforeseen and unintended consequences. Making good management decisions requires living and working in a single place for a lifetime rather than for short durations. “Nature’s ways” Bud believed “have to be respected if we are to prosper very long.” And these ways, he reminds us, are intricate and need both human emotions _and_ applied science to become defensible.

After we return to our busy lives at work and school, Bill will still be here. I think that being here does matter, and that despite cost, efficiency, or current politics, the very act of remaining in one place and becoming familiar with its personality is more important than ever. I pause for a moment and inhale the smokey air. The wind blows across my cheek. I think of it fanning the flames of the nearby Lolo Complex Fires. Ground squirrels chatter in the nearby rocks and where the sky once was is now only smoke. I would, if possible, lie down next to the lookout in the bear grass and never leave.
