## Diablo Peak

Jack, Chris, and I have spent the last two weeks traveling across Idaho— beginning in the Frank Church Wilderness and now moving onto the Selway-Bitterroot— taking photos of fire lookouts and interviewing those who work on active sites. We feel beat up and tired, our skin is leathery, and our lips are cracking from the drastic shifts in elevation.

My girlfriend, Kourt, has driven down to the Lochsa country of central Idaho (north of The Church) to meet us. The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness touches seven ranger districts, the Lochsa being one. Together we are hiking to Diablo Peak where long-time wilderness activist Bill Moore spends two weeks each year as a lookout staff. Like Pam, Bill runs a volunteer lookout program that provides an additional level of fire reduction and helps keep the tradition of lookouts alive.
