## Sundance Mountain

In the Department of Lands office in Nordman, Idaho, Pam Aunan, tosses me a forest green shirt with the word “fire” printed in large white letters on the front. I met Pam just two weeks ago when my colleagues, <a href="https://bonnercountydailybee.com/news/2021/may/18/digital-archive-documents-caribou-extirpation-nort/" target="_blank">Jack Kredell and Chris Lamb</a>, and I had interviewed her at Sundance Mountain Lookout in the Selkirk Mountains.

Pam, who runs the volunteer fire lookout program for the Preist Lake fire district, called me last week because an unexpected opening became available on the tower. She wanted to offer me and my dog, Trout, the chance to work for a few days as a lookout, thinking it would be a good opportunity for someone studying lookouts to be one. I agreed immediately, in part because Sundance Lookout was the site of a lightning strike that ignited the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_int/int_rp056.pdf" target="_blank">1967 Sundance Fire</a>, burning fifty-thousand acres and killing two firefighters. The fire was exceptional by mid-twentieth century standards because it made an anomalous run of sixteen miles in just nine hours. It was the focus of numerous studies on unpredictable fire behavior thereafter, although burns of such severity and unpredictability have become common as climate change's effects ignite volatile fuel loads. These days, many wildfires are as severe as the Sundance Fire.
