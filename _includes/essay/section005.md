Through the window, a breeze sneaks in. The tower is about 15 degrees cooler than the valley. The bear grass makes the air smell sweet, and the last patches of snow are melting at a perceptible rate. A pine snag on the ridge to my southeast stands in an otherwise healthy forest, and below it the highwater mark of evening inches closer. I fixate on this steady pull between night and day. The sun’s geometry positions the tree at the fulcrum of light and dark. I glance at my phone: 7:38 p.m.

The sun dips behind the mountains. The evening neon radiates through bars of smoke rising above the Selkirks, and a stratum of ozone and geology slowly dims into the night sky. Venus appears to my west. The universe flickers on. The Milky Way swirls like a parking lot oil stain as I lie in bed reading William Least Heat-Moon’s _Blue Highways_.

In _Blue Highways’_, young Heat-Moon has lost his English lectureship, and his marriage is dissolving. Devastated, he sets out on a circular journey traveling from New England and through the southwestern United States, into the Pacific Northwest before veering east again. The only discernible destination is where he began. He drives a green Astrovan named Ghost Dancing after the Native American ritual which foretold the return of departed spirits and the end of colonial expansion.

Making his way through the American Southwest, Heat-Moon reflects on the smells and nuances of the central Nevada desert. Its lonesomeness makes him consider the Latin root of the English word vacation, which is _vacare_ (meaning “to be empty”). He uses the open space to infuse himself with impressions of the landscape and foster a connection to the non-interior world. To see himself _out there_ in the desert and merge with the interstitial absence of the Nevada landscape and finally be “absorbed” by it.

Heat-Moon looks out of Ghost Dancing and sees himself reflected in the pellucidity of the van window, transposed onto the desert. Quoting Whitman, he describes “…the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet….” Seeing yourself as connected to and part of the exterior world is a common first step toward an ethics that accounts for the interconnected nature of the world and cosmos. Lookouts seem to facilitate this swiveling between _self_ and the _more-than-self_ because of their innate architecture. The panoramic windows provide easy access between the inside and outside world and allow one to glean their place in the larger landscape while protected from the elements.

I put down Blue Highways and turn off my headlamp, get out of my sleeping bag, and walk to the window. Between the inside of the cabin and the night sky, the windows and propane lamp transpose my face onto the universe. I walk to the deck and suddenly all that remains is black plasma where my face was.
