We noticed the high-water marks around the shorelines of the lakes as we hiked up the trail. The water was low due to a combination of severe drought and tectonic alteration from a recent earthquake. Up higher, the tower was beginning to take shape and I could see a looming figure hunched over a yogurt container eating breakfast. I let out an insecure howdy and watched whoever was inside fumble to put on a shirt. A man came out and introduced himself as Andy Baca—a long-time lookout and elk hunting guide with a PhD in history. Andy would stare off into the landscape as he talked, and we asked questions about working and living on lookouts. “It’s a little geologically sketchy up here. But you know if my time is up, it’s up, I guess. I would rather be buried up here than anywhere else.” Behind the lookout was a large fissure in the ground.
