Five thousand feet below us the Salmon River rushed by and high mountain wildflowers bloomed, more species than I could count or identify, really. They seemed to be some kind of mountain heather and cinquefoil. On a ridge above us, Chicken Peak must be the most unique cabin in the entire state of Idaho with its prominent roof and bright orange paint. Inside the floor was collapsing around an intact podium upon which the fire finder once sat. On this podium were the initials of lovers collected over the years. I took out my pocket knife and carved MD + KW with a heart around it. "Oh shit smoke" Jack says. I turn around and stare out of the smashed windows, my gaze directed in a very particular way, and see a plume of smoke rising from behind a ridge. For hours, we watched the plume grow into a cloud and, briefly, the sun burst through the smoke creating a kaleidoscopic refraction. What we were seeing was the Dixie Jumbo Fire, as confirmed by a friend through a text message on my Garmin InReach.
